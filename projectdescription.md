    <p>GSAsite is an online forum designed to connect members of the LGBTQ community with one another to form friendships and support groups, while providing allies an opportunity to educate themselves on the concerns and challenges facing gender, sexual, and romantic minorities in a safe, online space.</p>

    <p>GSAsite allows users to register accounts with unique usernames in order to be able to create and interact with posts made by other users. Developers will be able to moderate activity on the forum so that rambunctious users do not disrupt the development of the online community.</p>

    <p>We hope to develop more complex features such as HTTPS, password hashing, email verification, and an integrated support ticket system as the site develops an online presence.</p>
